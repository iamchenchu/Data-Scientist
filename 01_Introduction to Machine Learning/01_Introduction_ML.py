What is Machine Learning : The science of getting computers to learn and act like humans do, and improve 
their learning over time in autonomous fashion, by feeding them data and information in the form of 
observations and real-world interactions.

Why Machine Learning : To make predictions or decisions based on data, to automate tasks, to discover patterns

How Machine Learning Works : Data Collection, Data Preprocessing, Model Selection, Model Training, Model Evaluation,

Machine Learning Pipeline : Data Collection, Data Preprocessing, Feature Engineering, Model Selection, Model Training, Model Evaluation, Model Deployment

Machine Learning Workflow : Data Collection, Data Preprocessing, Exploratory Data Analysis, Feature Engineering, Model Selection, Model Training, Model Evaluation, Model Deployment

What is Supervised Machine Learning : The process of training a model on a labelled dataset, which means that 
the dataset already contains the correct answers, and the model learns to predict the output from the input
data.

What is Unsupervised Machine Learning : The process of training a model on an unlabelled dataset, which means  that
the dataset does not contain the correct answers, and the model learns to find patterns in the input data.

What is Reinforcement Learning : The process of training a model to make a sequence of decisions, by rewarding
the model for making the right decisions and punishing the model for making the wrong decisions.
